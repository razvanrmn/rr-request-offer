Woocommerce Request Offer
This plugin adds a "Request an Offer" button under the "Add to Cart" button for WooCommerce products. The button is displayed based on product category conditions (appears for certain categories but not for others) and is always shown for out-of-stock products. The request form is powered by the Forminator plugin, allowing customers to easily inquire about products.
